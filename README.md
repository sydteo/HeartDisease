# HeartDisease

**What is this about?**
- This dataset is taken from Kaggle
- Implementing Machine Learning models (Only supervised learning) to predict heart disease

**What I learnt.*
- Supervised learning: Logistic Regression, Tree Decision, Random Forest
- The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning 
- Working with basic libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib

**Things to improve on.*
- Be able to work with more advanced libraries such as Tensorflow
- Practice more on the in-built functions provided by the basic libraries
